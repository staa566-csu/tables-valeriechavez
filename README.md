I am interesting in looking and how different groups of secondary students experienced bullying in the last 3 years. 

Data are from the 2019-20, 2020-21, and 2021-22 school years. And come from 30 states, 782 schools, 203 districts, and over 350K students. 

I want to summarize their responses to the question "Have you been bullied this school year" and further probing into how that bullying occured (physically, verbally, digitally, etc.). These were asked through a series of yes/no questions. As such, I will use a chi-square test o compare their results 

Data is from Youth Truth Student Survey, and raw data files can't be shared
